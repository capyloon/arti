# Arti: reimplementing Tor in Rust

Arti is a project to produce an embeddable, production-quality implementation
of the [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) anonymity protocols in the
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.

## Why rewrite Tor in Rust?

Rust is *more secure than C*.  Despite our efforts, it's all too simple to
mess up when using a language that does not enforce memory safety.  We
estimate that at least half of our tracked security vulnerabilities would
have been impossible in Rust, and many of the others would have been very
unlikely.

Rust enables *faster development than C*. Because of Rust's expressiveness
and strong guarantees, we've found that we can be far more efficient and
confident writing code in Rust.  We hope that in the long run this will
improve the pace of our software development.

Arti is *more flexible than our C tor implementation*.  Unlike our C `tor`,
which was designed as SOCKS proxy originally, and whose integration features
were later "bolted on", Arti is designed from the ground up to work as a
modular, embeddable library that other applications can use.

Arti is *cleaner than our C tor implementation*.  Although we've tried to
develop C tor well, we've learned a lot since we started it back in 2002.
There are lots of places in the current C codebase where complicated
"spaghetti" relationships between different pieces of code make our software
needlessly hard to understand and improve.


## <a name="status"></a>Current status

Arti can connect to the Tor network, bootstrap a
view of the Tor directory, and make anonymized connections over the network.
Now that Arti has reached version 1.0.0, we believe it is suitable for
actual use to anonymise connections.

There are a number of areas (especially at the lower layers) where APIs
(especially internal APIs) are not stable,
and are likely to change them.
Right now that includes the command line interface to the `arti` program.

And of course it's still very new so there are likely to be bugs.

## Building and using Arti

Arti can act as a SOCKS proxy that uses the Tor network.

We expect to be providing official binaries soon.
But, for now, you need to obtain a
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) development environment,
and build it yourself.

To try it out, compile and run the `arti` binary using the below. It will open a
SOCKS proxy on port 9150.

    $ cargo run -p arti --release -- proxy

You can build a binary (but not run it) with:

    $ cargo build -p arti --release

The result can be found as `target/release/arti`.

If you run into any trouble building the program, please have a
look at [the troubleshooting guide](doc/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

### Hidden service (`.onion` service) client support

Arti has support for connecting to Onion Services aka Tor Hidden Services.

However, currently it is disabled by default.

This is because Arti currently lacks the
"vanguards" feature that Tor uses to prevent guard discovery attacks over time.
As such, you should probably stick with C Tor if you need to make a large
number of onion service connections, or if you are using the Tor protocol
in a way that lets an attacker control how many onion services connections that you make -
for example, when using Arti's SOCKS support from a web browser such as Tor Browser.

We plan to improve the security, and will then enable `.onion` connections by default.

In the meantime, if you would like to try it out,
you can
enable it on the command line (`cargo run -p arti -o address_filter.allow_onion_addrs=true proxy`).
or
edit your config file (set `allow_onion_addrs = true` in the section `[address_filter]`)

Then you can make a connection to a `.onion` service, via Arti.
For example, to try it out from the command line:
```
target/release/arti -o address_filter.allow_onion_addrs=true proxy
# and in another window:
curl --socks5-hostname localhost:9150 https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion/ | head | cat -v
```

### Custom compile-time options

Arti has a number of configurable
[Cargo features](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html)
that, among other things, can affect which asynchronous runtime to use.

See in the
[Arti crate-level docs](https://tpo.pages.torproject.net/core/doc/rust/arti/index.html#compile-time-features)
for details.

## Using Arti as a library

The `arti` command line utility is built on top of the 
[`arti_client`](https://tpo.pages.torproject.net/core/doc/rust/arti_client/index.html)
library (and its dependencies).

That library's API will allow you to
make connections over the Tor network,
and obtain streams/sinks usable from async Rust.

## Minimum supported Rust Version

Our current Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is 1.65.

When increasing this MSRV, we won't require any Rust version released in the
last six months. (That is, we'll only require Rust versions released at least
six months ago.)

We will not increase MSRV on PATCH releases, though our dependencies might.

We won't increase MSRV just because we can: we'll only do so when we have a
reason. (We don't guarantee that you'll agree with our reasoning; only that
it will exist.)

## Roadmap

Thanks to a generous grant from
[Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG)](https://zcashomg.org/), we're able to devote
some significant time to Arti in the years 2021-2022.  Here is our _rough_
set of plans for what we hope to deliver when.

The goal times below are complete imagination, based on broad assumptions about
developer availability.  Please don't take them too seriously until we can
get our project manager to sign off on them.
