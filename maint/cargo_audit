# List of vulnerabilities to ignore.  It's risky to do this, so we should
# only do this when two circumstances hold:
#   1. The vulnerability doesn't affect us.
#   2. We can't update to an unaffected version.
#   3. We have a plan to not have this vulnerability ignored forever.
#
# If you add anything to this section, make sure to add a comment
# explaining why it's safe to do so.

    # This is not a vulnerability but an unmaintained warn for the
    # `net2` crate. It's pulled indirectly by `notify` 4.0. It's
    # fixed in `notify` 5.0 however only pre-releases are available
    # for now.

    # This is not a vulnerability but an unmaintained warn for the
    # `tempdir` crate. It was pulled by `tls-api` 0.7.0. `tls-api`
    # 0.8.0 switched to tempfile instead.

    # This is a vulnerability in the `nix` crate caused by an
    # out-of-bounds write in `getgrouplist`.  We got our `nix`
    # dependency via `async-ctrlc`, which uses `ctrlc`, which uses
    # `nix`.
    #
    # Why this didn't affect us:
    #  * ctrlc doesn't use `getgrouplist`.
    #
    # Why we couldn't update to a better version of `nix`:
    #  * ctrlc version 3.2.0 and earlier were stuck on `nix` 0.22.
    #
    # How it was fixed:
    #  * ctrlc version 3.2.1 upgraded its `nix` dependency to 0.23.
    --ignore RUSTSEC-2021-0119
    # This is a vulnerability in the `time` crate.  We don't import
    # `time` directly, but inherit it through the `oldtime` feature
    # in `chrono`.  The vulnerability occurs when somebody messes
    # with the environment while at the same time calling a function
    # that uses localtime_r.
    #
    # Why this doesn't affect us:
    #   * We never use the time crate, and we never mess with local times via the time crate.  We only get the time crate accidentally
    #     because rusqlite builds chrono with its default-features
    #     enabled.
    #
    # Why we can't update to a better version of `time`:
    #   * Chrono's `oldtime` feature requires `time` 0.1.43, and can't
    #     be update to `time` 0.2.x.
    #   * Rusqlite's feature that enables `chrono` support does so by
    #     depending on `chrono` with default features, which includes
    #     `oldtime`.
    #
    # What we can do:
    #  * Get rusqlite to update its dependency on `chrono` to not
    #    include `oldtime`.
    #    (PR: https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite/pull/1031 )
    #  * Stop using the `chrono` feature on rusqlite, and do our date
    #    conversions in `tor-dirmgr` manually.
    #
    # Eventual resolution: we migrated to use time 0.3 instead of chrono.
    --ignore RUSTSEC-2020-0071
    # This vulnerability affects the `chrono` crate: it uses
    # `localtime_r()`, which is not thread-safe if anybody calls
    # `setenv()`.
    #
    # This is concerning!  What makes it not disastrous is:
    #  * We don't use chrono for any local times in Arti: only Utc.
    #  * We don't modify the environment.
    #
    # There is no unaffected version of chrono yet.
    #
    # Fortunately (?), the whole Rust ecosystem is currently freaking
    # out about chrono, so we can hope there's a solution before too long.
    #
    # Eventual resolution: we migrated to use time 0.3 instead of chrono.
