## Status

This is a draft document.
It does not reflect anything we've built,
or anything we necessarily will build.

It attempts to describe semantics for an RPC mechanism
for use in Arti.

By starting with our RPC mechanism
and its semantics,
we aim to define a set of operations
that we can implement reasonably
for both local and out-of-process use.

This document will begin by focusing
on the _semantics_ of our RPC system
using an abstract stream of objects.

Once those are defined, we'll discuss
a particular instantiation of the system
using the `jsonlines` encoding:
we intend that other encodings should also be possible,
in case we need to change in the future.

Finally, we will describe an initial series of methods
that the system could support,
to start exploring the design space, and
to show what our specifications might look like going forward,

# Intended semantics

## Sessions

The application begins by establishing a session with Arti.
There may be multiple sessions at once,
but each applications should only need one at a time.

Sessions are authenticated enough to prove at least
that they that they're launched by an authorized user,
and aren't coming from a confused web browser or something.

(This authentication can use unix domain sockets,
proof of an ability to read some part of the filesystem,
or a pre-established shared secret.
Sessions should not normally cross the network.
If they do, they must use TLS.)

Different sessions cannot access one another's status:
they cannot ordinarily list each other's circuits,
get information on each other's requests,
see each other's onion services,
and so on.

As an exception, a session may have administrative access.
If it does, it can access information from any session.

(This isolation is meant to resist
programming mistakes and careless application design,
but it is not sufficient to sandbox
a hostile application:
Such an application could, for example,
use CPU or network exhaustion
to try to detect other applications' load and behavior.
We don't try to resist attacks on that level.)

In this specification, sessions are not persistent:
once a session is closed, there is no way to re-establish it.
Instead, the application must start a new session,
without access to the previous session's state.
We may eventually provide a way to make sessions persistent
and allow apps to re-connect to a session,
but that will not be the default.


## Messages

Once a connection is established, the application and Arti
communicate in a message-oriented format
inspired by JSON-RPC (and its predecessors).
Messages are sent one at a time in each direction,
in an ordered stream.

The application's messages are called "requests".
Arti's replies are called "responses".
Every response will be in response to a single request.

A response may be an "update", an "error", or a "result".
An "error" or a "result" is a "final response":
that is, it is the last response
that will be sent in answer to a request.
An update, however, may be followed
by zero or more updates responses,
and up to one error or result.
By default, requests will _only_ receive final responses,
unless the application specifically tags the request
as accepting updates.
All updates are tagged as such.

A "result" indicates a successful completion
of an operation;
an "error" indicates a failure.

> Note that although the client must be prepared
> to receive a final response for any request,
> some request types will never get one in practice.
> For example, a request to observe all circuit-build events
> will receive only a series of updates.

Messages are representable as JSON -
specifically, the are within the subset defined in RFC7493 (I-JSON).
In the current concrete protocol they are *represented as* JSON;
we may define other encodings/framings in the future.

## Requests, Objects, and Visibility

Every request is directed to some Object.
(For example, an object may be a session,
a circuit, a stream, an onion service,
or the arti process itself.)
In this document, Object means the target of a request;
not a JSON document object.

Only certain Objects are visible within a given session.
When a session is first created,
the session itself is the only Object visible.
Other Objects may become visible
in response to the application's requests.
If an Object is not visible in a session,
that session cannot access it.

Clients identify each Object within a session
by an opaque string, called an "Object Identifier".
Each identifier may be a "handle" or a "reference".
If a session has a _handle_ to an Object,
Arti won't deliberately discard that Object
until it the handle is "released",
or the session is closed.
If a session only has a _reference_ to an Object, however,
that Object might be closed or discarded in the background,
and there is no need to release it.

The format of an Object Identifier string is not stable,
and clients must not rely on it.


## Request and response types

There are different kinds of requests,
each identified by a unique method name.

Each method is associated with a set of named parameters.
Some requests can be sent to many kinds of Object;
some are only suitable for one kind of Object.

When we define a method,
we state its name,
and the names and types of the parameters `params`.
and the expected contents of the successful `result`,
and any `updates`s.

Unrecognized parameters must be ignored.
Indeed, any unrecognized fields in a JSON object must be ignored,
both by the server and by the client.

Invalid JSON
and parameter values that do not match their specified types
must be treated as an error,
both by the server and by the client.

## Data Streams

We do not want to force users
to mix application data streams and control connections
on a single pipe.
But we need a way to associate application requests
with RPC sessions,
so that the application can manipulate their own streams.

We can do this in two ways.

1. When an RPC-using application wants to open a stream,
   it uses a request message to tell Arti what kind of stream it wants,
   and where the stream should go.
   Arti replies with an opaque identifier for the stream.
   The application then opens a data connection
   (e.g. via the SOCKS port)
   and gives that identifier as the target address for the stream.

2. The application asks Arti for a session-identifier
   suitable for tagging its data streams.
   Arti replies with such an identifier.
   The application then attaches that identifier
   to every data stream it opens
   (e.g. via a SOCKS authentication mechanism)
   and Arti uses it to identify which streams belong to the application.


# Instantiating our semantics with JSON, Rust, and Serde

## Encoding with JSON

We use the following metaformat, based on JSON-RPC,
for our requests:

id
: An identifier for the request.
  This may be a number or a string. It is required.
  (Floating point numbers and
  integers that can't be precisely represented as an IEEE-754 double
  are not guaranteed to round trip accurately.
  Integers whose absolute value is no greater than
  `2^53-1 = 9007199254740991`,
  will round trip accurately.
  64-bit integers might not.)

obj
: An Object Identifier for the Object that will receive this request.
  This is a string.  It is required.

method
: A string naming the method to invoke. It is required.
  Method names are namespaced; see
  "Method Namespacing" below.

params
: A JSON object describing the parameters for the method.
  Its format depends on the method.
  (Unlike in JSON-RPC, this field is mandatory;
  or to put it another way, every method we define will
  require `params` to be provided,
  even if it is allowed to be empty.)

meta
: A JSON object describing protocol features to enable for this request.
  It is optional.
  Unrecognized fields are ignored.
  The only recognized field is currently:
  "updates"Â­a boolean that indicates whether
  updates are acceptable.
  It defaults to false.

> Note: It is not an error for the client to send
> multiple concurrent requests with the same `id`.
> If it does so, however, then Arti will reply
> with response(s) for each request,
> all of them with the same ID:
> this will likely make it hard for the client
> to tell the responses apart.
>
> Therefore, it is recommended that a client
> should not reuse an ID
> before it has received a final response for that ID.

Responses follow the following metaformat:

id
: An identifier for the request.
  It is (almost always) required.
  As in JSON-RPC, it will match the id of a request
  previously sent in this session.
  It will match the id of a request
  that has not received a final response.

  (As an exception:
  A error caused by a request in which the id could not be parsed
  will have no id itself.
  We can't use the id of the request with the syntax problem,
  since it couldn't be parsed.
  Such errors are always fatal;
  after sending one, the server will close the connection.)

update
: A JSON object whose contents depends on the request method.
  It is required on an update.

result
: A JSON object whose contents depends on the request method.
  It is required on a successful final response.

error
: A JSON error object, format TBD.
  It is required on a failed final response.
  Unlike a `result` and `update`,
  an error can be parsed and validated without knowing the request method.

Any given response will have exactly one of
"update", "result", and "error".

> Note:

#### Method namespacing

Any method name containing a colon belongs to a namespace.
The namespace of a method is everything up to the first colon.
(For example, the method name `arti:connect`
is in the namespace `arti`.
The method name `gettype` is not in any namespace.)

Only this spec MAY declare non-namespaced methods.
All methods defined elsewhere SHOULD be in a namespace.

Right now, the following namespaces are reserved:

* `arti` â For use by the Arti tor implementation project.
* `auth` â Defined in this spec; for authenticating an initial session.

To reserve a namespace, open a merge request to change the list above.

Namespaces starting with `x-` will never be allocated.
They are reserved for experimental use.

Method names starting with `x-` indicate
experimental or unstable status:
any code using them should expect to be unstable.


### Errors

Errors are reported as responses with an `error` field (as above).
The `error` field is itself an object, with the following fields:

message
: A String providing a short human-readable description of the error.
  Clients SHOULD NOT rely on any aspect of the format of this String, 
  or do anything with it besides display it to the end user.
  (This is generated by `tor_error::Report` or equivalant.)

kinds
: An array of Strings, each
  denoting a category of error.
  Kinds defined by Arti will begin with the prefix
  "arti:", and will
  denote one of the members of [`tor_error::ErrorKind`].

  If Arti renames an `ErrorKind`,
  the old name will be provided after the new name.
  If an error is reclassified,
  Arti will provide the previous classification
  (the previously reported kind)
  after the current classification,
  if it's meaningful,
  and it's reasonably convenient to do so.

  Therefore, a client which is trying to classify an error
  should look through the array from start to finish,
  stopping as soon as it finds a a recognised `ErrorKind`.

  Note that this set may be extended in future,
  so a client must be prepared to receive unknown values from Arti,
  and fall back to some kind of default processing.

data
: A JSON value containing additional error information.
  An application may use this to handle certain known errors,
  but must always be prepared to receive unknown errors.

  The value of `data` will be one of the following:
    * a string, being the error data type name
    * an object with a single field; the field name is the error data type name;
      the meaning of the value of that field depends on the error data type name.

  Each method type name defines the format of the associated value.
  (Note: this is the "externally tagged" serde serialisation format for a Rust enum.)

  The error data type names are in a global namespace,
  like method names.
  The `data` can be parsed without knowing the method that generated the error,
  although obviously the meaning will depend on what operation was being attempted.

  Improved error handling in Arti may make Arti generate
  different error `data` for particular situations in the future,
  so clients should avoid relying on the precise contents,
  other than for non-critical functions such as reporting.

code
: A Number that indicates the error type that occurred according
  to the following table.
  The values are in accordance with the JSON-RPC specification.

  The `code` field is provided for JSON-RPC compatibility,
  and its use is not recommended.
  Use `kinds` to distinguish error categories instead.
  For example, instead of comparing `code` to `-32601`,
  recognise `RpcMethodNotFound` in `kinds`.

```
code 	message 	meaning
-32600 	Invalid Request 	The JSON sent is not a valid Request object.
-32601 	Method not found 	The method does not exist / is not available on this object.
-32602 	Invalid params 		Invalid method parameter(s).
-32603 	Internal error		The server suffered some kind of internal problem
1	Object error		Some requested object was not valid
2	Request error		Some other error occurred.
```

We do not anticipate regularly extending this list of values.

[`tor_error::ErrorKind`]: https://docs.rs/tor-error/latest/tor_error/enum.ErrorKind.html

#### Example error response JSON document

Note: this is an expanded display for clarity!
Arti will actually send an error response on a single line,
to conform to jsonlines framing.

```
{
   "id" : "5631557cdce0caa0",
   "error" : {
      "message" : "Cannot connect to a local-only address without enabling allow_local_addrs",
      "kinds" : [
         "ForbiddenStreamTarget"
      ],
      "data" : {
         "arti::ErrorDetail::Address" : "BadOnion",
      },
      "code" : -32001
   }
}
```

#### JSON-RPC compatibility

This error format is compatible with JSON-RPC 2.0.
The differences are:

 * Input that cannot be parsed as JSON is not reported as an error;
   it is dealt with at the framing layer
   (probably, by summarily closing the transport connection)

 * The `kinds` field has been added,
   and use of `code` is discouraged.

 * The `message` field may be less concise than JSON-RPC envisages.

### We use I-JSON

In this spec JSON means I-JSON (RFC7493).
The client must not send JSON documents that are not valid I-JSON.
(but Arti may not necessarily reject such documents).
Arti will only send valid I-JSON
(assuming the client does so too).

We speak of `fields`, meaning the members of a JSON object.

### A variant: JSON-RPC.

> (This is not something we plan to build
> unless it's actually needed.)
>
> If, eventually, we need backward compatibility
> with the JSON-RPC protocol,
> we will wrap the above request and response JSON objects
> in JSON-RPC requests and responses.
>
> Under this scheme,
> it will not be possible to support updates (intermediate responses)
> unless we add a regular "poll" request or something:
> this is also left for future work.

## Framing messages

Arti's responses are formatted according to [jsonlines](jsonlines.org):
every message appears as precisely one line, terminated with a single linefeed.
(Clients are recommended to format their requests as jsonlines
for ease of debugging and clarity,
but JSON documents are self-delimiting and
Arti will parse them disregarding any newlines.)

Clients may send as many requests at the same time as they like.
arti may send the responses in any order.
I.e., *arti may send responses out of order*.

If a client sends too many requests at once,
arti may stop reading the transport connection,
until arti has dealt with and replied to some of them.
There is no minimum must-be-supported number or size of concurrent requests.
Therefore a client which sends more than one request at a time
must be prepared to buffer requests at its end,
while concurrently reading arti's replies.

## Authentication

When a connection is first opened,
only a single "connection" object is available.
Its object ID is "`connection`".
The client must authenticate to the connection
in order to receive any other object IDs.

The pre-authentication methods available on a connection are:

auth:get_rpc_protocol
: Ask Arti which version of the protocol is in use.

auth:query
: Ask Arti which authentication schemes are acceptable.

auth:authenticate
: Try to authenticate using one of the provided authentication
  methods.

> TODO: Provide more information about these in greater detail.

Three recognized authentication schemes are:

inherent:peer_uid
: Attempt to authenticate based on the the application's
  user-id.

inherent:unix_path
: Attempt to authenticate based on the fact that the application
  has opened a connection to a given named socket,
  which shouldn't be possible unless it is running on behalf
  of an authorized user.

fs:cookie
: Attempt to authenticate based on the application's ability
  to read a small cookie from the filesystem,
  which shouldn't be possible unless it is running on behalf
  of an authorized user.

> TODO Maybe add a "this is a TLS session and I presented a good certificate"
> type?

Until authentication is successful on a connection,
Arti closes the connection after any error.

> Taking a lesson from Tor's control port:
> we always want a correct authentication handshake to complete
> before we allow any requests to be handled,
> even if the stream itself is such
> that no authentication should be requires.
> This helps prevent cross-protocol attacks in cases
> where things are misconfigured.


## Specifying requests and replies.

When we are specifying a request, we list the following.

* The method string for the request.

* Which types of Object can receive that request.

* The allowable format for that request's associated parameters.
  This is always given as a Rust struct
  annotated for use with serde.

* The allowable formats for any responses
  for the request.
  This is always given as a Rust struct or enum,
  annotated for use with serde.


# Differences from JSON-RPC

 * We use I-JSON (RFC7493).

 * Every request must have an `obj` field.

 * A request's `id` may not be `null`.

 * There can be `update`s - non-final responses.

 * We specify a framing protocol
   (although we permit new framing protocols in the future).

 * We have connection-oriented session state.

 * We support overlapping and pipelined responses,
   rather than batched multi-requests.

 * TODO our errors are likely to be a superset of JSON-RPC's.  TBD.

 * TODO re-check this spec against JSON-RPC.


# A list of requests

## Cancellation

> TODO: take a request ID (as usual),
> and the ID of the request-to-cancel as a parameter.
>
> (Using the 'id' as the subject of the request is too cute IMO,
> even if we change the request's meaning to
> "cancel every request with the same id as this request".)

To try to cancel a request,
there is a "cancel" method, taking arguments of the form:

```
{ "request_id": id }
```

A successful response is the empty JSON object.
If a successful response is sent,
then the request was canceled,
and an error was sent for the canceled request.

If the request has already completed
before the "cancel" request is canceled,
or if there is no such request,
Arti will return an error.
(It might not be possible to distinguish these two cases).


TODO: Currently this violates our rule that every request has an `obj`.
Options: 
 1. Relax the rule
 2. Specify a well-known `obj` value to be used;
    we will need such a thing to bootstrap auth anyway.
 3. Specify that the cancellation should be sent to the original object.
    IMO this is improper:
    cancellation is a framing operation.

# Appendix: Some example APIs to wrap this

Every library that wraps this API
should probably follow a similar design
(except when it makes sense to do so).

There should probably be a low-level API
that handles arbitrary raw JSON objects as requests and responses,
along with a higher level library
generated from our JSON schema[^schema].
There should also be some even-higher-level functionality
to navigate the authentication problem,
and for functionality like opening streams.

[^schema]: and by the way, we should have some schemas[^plural]
[^plural]: Or schemata if you prefer that for the plural.

## Generic, low-level

I'm imagining that the low level
of any arti-RPC client library
will probably look a little like this:

```
type UrlLikeString = String;
`/// Open the session, authenticate.
fn open_session(UrlLikeString, prefs: ?) -> Result<Session>;

type Request = JsonObj/String;
type Response = JsonObj/String;
enum ResponseType {Update, Error, Result};
/// Run a request, block till it succeeds or fails
fn do(Session, Request) -> Result<Response>;
type Callback = fn(Response, VoidPtr);
/// Launch a command, return immediately.  Invoke the callback whenever there
/// is more info.
fn launch(Session, Request, Callback, VoidPtr) -> Result<()>;

// ---- These are even more low-level... not sure if they're
//       a good idea.

/// Send a request, and don't wait for a response.
fn send(Session, RequestId, Request, Option<RequestMeta>) -> Result<()>;
/// Read a response, if there is one to read.
fn recv(Session, blocking: bool) -> Result<Response>;
/// Return an fd that you can poll on to see if the session is ready
/// to read bytes.
fn poll_id(Session) -> Option<Fd>;
```

# Appendix

Experimenting with Arti

We have a limited implementation of this protocol in Arti right now,
on an experimental basis.
It only works on Unix, with `tokio`.
To try it, enable the `rpc` Cargo feature on the `arti` crate,
and then connect to `~/.arti-rpc-TESTING/PIPE`.  (You can use
`nc -U` to do this.)

Right now only two commands are supported:
Authenticating and an echo command.
The echo command will only work post-authentication.

Here is an example session:

```
>>> {"id": "abc", "obj": "connection", "method": "auth:get_rpc_protocol", "params": {}}
<<< {"id":"abc","result":{"version":"alpha"}}
>>> {"id": "abc", "obj": "connection", "method": "auth:query", "params": {}}
<<< {"id":"abc","result":{"schemes":["inherent:unix_path"]}}
>>> {"id": 3, "obj": "connection", "method": "auth:authenticate", "params": {"scheme": "inherent:unix_path"}}
<<< {"id":3,"result":{"session":"2yFi5qrMD9LbIWLmqswP0iTenRlVM_Au"}}
>>> {"id": 4, "obj": "2yFi5qrMD9LbIWLmqswP0iTenRlVM_Au", "method": "arti:x-echo", "params": {"msg": "Hello World"}}
<<< {"id":4,"result":{"msg":"Hello World"}}
```

Note that the server will currently close your connection
at the first sign of invalid JSON.

Please don't expect the final implementation to work this way!
