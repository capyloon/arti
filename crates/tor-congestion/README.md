# tor-congestion

`tor-congestion`: algorithms for congestion control on the Tor network

## Overview

This crate is part of
[Arti](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/), a project to
implement [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) in Rust.

This implements some of the algorithms needed to implement congestion control
as part of
[Tor proposal #324](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/torspec/-/blob/main/proposals/324-rtt-congestion-control.txt).
